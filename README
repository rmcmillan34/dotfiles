# Dotfiles Repository
This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration scripts for setting up a development environment on Linux. It includes configurations for various tools, applications, and environments.

## Installation
To install the dotfiles, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash

Depending on the environment you want to set up, you can run one of the following using the included Makefile.

```bash
./bootstrap.sh        # for core tools
